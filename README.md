# Abhay Agarwal — AI / ML Engineer & Systems Builder

**Electrical Engineer by degree. Machine Learning engineer by practice.**

This repository contains my interactive developer portfolio, showcasing my work in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Systems Engineering, and Full-Stack Development.

I build end-to-end systems — from research ideas and raw data to deployed applications.

## About Me

I'm Abhay Agarwal, a developer and researcher focused on solving real-world problems using Artificial Intelligence and scalable software systems.

**My primary interests:**

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Computer Vision & Remote Sensing
- LLM Reasoning Systems
- Distributed Systems & Backend Engineering

I enjoy working on problems where software meets reasoning, data, and engineering constraints.

## Research Areas

### 🌍 Pixel-Level Landslide Intelligence

Developing semantic segmentation models on satellite imagery to precisely locate landslide-affected terrain instead of simple classification.

### 🧊 Glacier Burst Detection

Analyzing multi-temporal remote sensing data to detect structural changes in glacial lakes and identify potential outburst flood risks.

### 🧠 Multi-Phase Chain-of-Thought LLM Systems

Designing structured reasoning pipelines where LLMs plan, verify, and refine intermediate steps using tool-augmented workflows.
