## 👨‍🎓 About Me -> Hello World, MySelf Abhay Agarwal
[IMAGE:/206020807.jpg,/image.png]
I don’t like buzzwords.
I like building things that actually work.
I’m **Abhay Agarwal** — an AI engineer who builds autonomous systems that solve real problems. I specialize in multi-agent orchestration, RAG architectures, and LLM-powered automation — designing end-to-end systems from retrieval pipelines to production deployment.

I'm currently pursuing my degree while actively shipping AI agents, fine-tuning workflows, and building production-grade systems that go beyond demos. I don't wait for frameworks to mature — I experiment with new architectures, stress-test retrieval systems, and iterate until the metrics prove it works.

- SHAP & LIME: Feature-level interpretability for predictions -Bias Detection Metrics: Identifies fairness issues across groups
-LangChain: Generates human-readable explanations summarizing model reasoning
-FastAPI Backend: Handles computation and API endpoints
-Streamlit Dashboard: Interactive frontend for visualization and reporting
-This system is ideal for ML model monitoring, AI observability, and ethical AI deployment.
> It empowers data scientists and stakeholders to understand model behavior, ensure fairness, and build trust in AI systems.

**1️⃣1️⃣ Conway Game of Life Simulator **
*Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. This project implements the simulation in Python using object-oriented programming principles and provides both visual and console-based representations of the evolving grid.*
[IMAGE:/conway.png,/conway2.png]
This simulation follows the rules of Conway's Game of Life:
1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die, and all other dead cells stay dead.
4. Implemented in Python using basic OOP concepts, list operations, and visualization using matplotlib.
Features:
1. Create and initialize a custom grid of any size.
2. Populate the grid with live cells at specific coordinates.
3. Step-by-step evolution of the grid.
4. Run multiple steps at once.
5. Console-based and graphical visualization of the grid.
